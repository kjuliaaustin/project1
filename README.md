# A Global Perspective: Factors Influencing Life Expectancy
In SQL and Python


This data analysis project aimed to explore various aspects of life expectancy across different countries and continents, as well as factors that might influence life expectancy, such as GDP, education, healthcare, and mental health disorders. Here's a breakdown of the project steps and key findings:

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Renamed countries for consistency (e.g., "United States of America" to "United States").
Removed duplicate records.
Filled in missing values for status and life expectancy.
## Exploratory Data Analysis:
Calculated the average life expectancy by year and continent.
Investigated the correlation between life expectancy and GDP, BMI, healthcare metrics (e.g., physicians per thousand, out-of-pocket health expenditure), and mental health disorders.
## Key Findings:
Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancies.
Developed countries have higher life expectancies than developing countries.
There is a positive correlation between life expectancy and the number of physicians per thousand people.
Europe has the highest life expectancy and GDP among continents, while Africa has the lowest.
Mental health disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression vary among countries but don't show a clear correlation with life expectancy.
## Visualization and Interpretation:
Created visualizations to illustrate trends and correlations found in the data.
Provided interpretations of the data, highlighting significant findings and trends.
## Conclusions:
Life expectancy varies widely across countries and continents, influenced by factors such as GDP, healthcare infrastructure, and education.
Understanding these factors can help policymakers and healthcare professionals improve public health and quality of life in different regions.
